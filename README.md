# GFG-Interview Preperations
# Coding Questions

This repository contains my solutions to various coding questions. Each question is solved using a programming language mentioned in the respective directory.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into directories, with each directory representing a coding question. The structure of the repository is as follows:

```
- coding-question-1/
  - solution.ext
  - README.md
- coding-question-2/
  - solution.ext
  - README.md
- coding-question-3/
  - solution.ext
  - README.md
- ...
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/midnightripper/coding-questions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific coding question directory:
   ```
   cd coding-question-1
   ```

3. Read the `README.md` file in each directory to understand the problem statement and the approach used to solve it.

4. Open the solution file (`solution.ext`) in your preferred programming environment or editor to view the code.

5. Compile and run the code to see the solution in action.
